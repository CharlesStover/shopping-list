# Shopping List
This is a simple online shopping list management application. It was created for my father, who needed a printable shopping list for
his home care aides. To support his declining memory, the application keeps track of past items so that they may be re-added with ease.

## Tech Stack
* Docker - The final product is built into a Docker image and [deployed to DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/charlesstover/shopping-list/).
* nginx - nginx is configured as a static file server for a Single Page Application.
* React - The front end is powered by React for state management and dynamic rendering.

## Demo
